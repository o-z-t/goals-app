# goals-app
A cross-platform application to help individuals accomplish goals of any size.

Brainstorming
  "To do" feature but random within some scope of time, also repeatable
		this is so that the task is simplified but not monotonous. Just
		to get someone to do something semi-regularly first, eventually 
		build upo to the desired regularity. 
		Something that learns to adjust to how a user does things. So if
		they don't follow through, it makes it easier in someway. If they 			
		keep it going long enough, they get rewarded with exp but also a 
		slight challenge increase.
		Make a task and make it "quick do" or instant, along with other 
		levels. imagine using colors and animations to organize them. it 
		would sort them for you and make a plan of attack essentially
